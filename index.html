                Can Improve Energy Levels and Make You Smarter
            </h3>
            <p>Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels
                That’s because it contains a stimulant called <strong>caffeine</strong><br>
                the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world

            <h3>Can Help You Burn Fat</h3>
           <p> Caffeine is found in almost every commercial fat-burning supplement — and for good reason.
            It’s one of the few natural substances proven to aid fat burning.
            Several studies show that caffeine can boost your metabolic rate by 3–11%
            Other studies indicate that caffeine can specifically increase fat burning by as much as 10% in
            obese individuals and 29% in lean people
            However, ’s possible that these effects diminish in long-term coffee drinkers.
