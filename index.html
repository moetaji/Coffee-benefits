            <b>Can Improve Energy Levels and Make You Smarter</b>
        </h3>

        <p>Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels
            That’s because it contains a stimulant called <strong>caffeine</strong><br>
            the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world
        </p>

            <h3><b>Can Help You Burn Fat</b></h3>
            <p>
                Caffeine is found in almost every commercial fat-burning supplement — and for good reason.
                It’s one of the few natural substances proven to aid fat burning.<br>
                Several studies show that caffeine can boost your metabolic rate by 3–11%<br>
                Other studies indicate that caffeine can specifically increase fat burning by as much as 10% in
                obese individuals and 29% in lean people
                However, <br>’s possible that these effects diminish in long-term coffee drinkers.
